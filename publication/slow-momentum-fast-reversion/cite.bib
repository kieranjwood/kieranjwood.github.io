	abstract = {Momentum strategies are an important part of alternative investments and are at the heart of the work of commodity trading advisors. These strategies have, however, been found to have difficulties adjusting to rapid changes in market conditions, such as during the 2020 market crash. In particular, immediately after momentum turning points, when a trend reverses from an uptrend (downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum strategies are prone to making bad bets. To improve the responsiveness to regime change, the authors introduce a novel approach, in which they insert an online changepoint detection (CPD) module into a deep momentum network pipeline, which uses a long short-term memory deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend estimation and position sizing. Furthermore, their model is able to optimize the way in which it balances (1) a slow momentum strategy that exploits persisting trends but does not overreact to localized price moves and (2) a fast mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position and then swapping back again to exploit localized price moves. The CPD module outputs a changepoint location and severity score, allowing the model to learn to respond to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localized changepoints, in a data driven manner. The authors back test their model over the period 1995{\textendash}2020, and the addition of the CPD module leads to a 33\% improvement in the Sharpe ratio. The module is especially beneficial in periods of significant nonstationarity; in particular, over the most recent years tested (2015{\textendash}2020), the performance boost is approximately 66\%. This is especially interesting because traditional momentum strategies have underperformed in this period.},
