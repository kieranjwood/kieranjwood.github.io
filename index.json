We leverage recent developments from the deep learning community and use few-shot learning. We propose the Cross Attentive Time-Series Trend Network - X-Trend - which takes positions attending over a context set of financial time-series regimes. X-Trend transfers trends from similar patterns in the context set to make predictions and take positions for a new distinct target regime. X-Trend can also take zero-shot positions on novel unseen financial assets. It both forecasts next-day prices and outputs a trading signal. Furthermore, the cross-attention mechanism allows us to interpret the relationship between forecasts and patterns in the context set.","tags":[],"title":"Few-Shot Learning Patterns in Financial Time-Series for Trend-Following Strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kieran Wood","Sven Giegerich","Stephen Roberts","Stefan Zohren"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Unlike state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, which are sequential in nature, the attention mechanism provides our architecture with a direct connection to all previous time-steps. Our architecture enables us to learn longer-term dependencies, improves performance when considering returns net of transaction costs and naturally adapts to new market regimes, such as during the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. The Momentum Transformer is inherently interpretable, providing us with greater insights into our deep learning momentum trading strategy, including how it blends different classical strategies and the past time-steps which are of the greatest significance to the model.","tags":[],"title":"Trading with the Momentum Transformer: An Intelligent and Interpretable Architecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kieran Wood","Stephen Roberts","Stefan Zohren"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Our model is able to optimise the way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping it back again to exploit localised price moves.","tags":[],"title":"Slow Momentum with Fast Reversion: A Trading Strategy Using Deep Learning and Changepoint Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
